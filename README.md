Homework 1.1 – Complexity: Bubble Sort, Big O, Big Θ, Big Ω, and Search Algorithms in Python 3.

Python 3 program that:
- Combines Linear Search and iterative Binary Search.
- Adds operation counters (incremented internally).
- Uses the `timeit` library for timing calls.
- Generates an array of 200 random integers (no operation-count prints).
